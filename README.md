# HTML_to_ics_for_plan.ue.wroc.pl

This is a converter for students of the University of Economics in Wroc≈Çaw. Fell free to adjust this for yourself. In orginal version this need copy of element starting with <td colspan="2" class="tlo" and paste it in html_source.html. Once you run it, you should get an .ics file to import into any calendar :)
