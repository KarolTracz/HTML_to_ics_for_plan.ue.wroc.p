# HTML_to_ics_for_plan.ue.wroc.pl

This is a converter for students of the University of Economics in Wroc≈Çaw. Fell free to adjust this for yourself. In orginal version this need copy of element starting with <td colspan="2" class="tlo" and paste it in html_source.html. Once you run it, you should get an .ics file to import into any calendar :)
Known issue: Classes length is hardcoded to 1,5h some SEM is 2h long so if you have it please adjust it and other classes this day manually. This almost always is only once a semester so not so much big deal.
